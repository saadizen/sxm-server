Command to run: docker build -t sxm-server . && docker run -d -p 8081:8080 sxm-server

Then type in localhost:8081 inside a browser

You can replace localhost with 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1 or the ip address where the docker image is installed

I offer this docker image as a courtesy. If you don't wanna install anything or you don't know how then just use this website: [https://sxm.vercel.app](https://sxm.vercel.app)

It's the same thing but it will be updated and maintained more often
